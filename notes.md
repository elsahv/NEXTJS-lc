CURRENT NOTES: ON ‘CREATE YOUR OFFER’ VID

find your niche-”LC- target demand would be rich artists in the area, think of 60-year-old high deserter who has no time or patience for websites”

free value blog: tech assistance to senior citizens.??

-”reason not to work for free: a customer who pays is more invested in the business project, as opposed to a free customer”

- KEY MINDSHIFT SHIFTS:
- avoid the “too many options on the menu, also betraying yourself as the budget option”

- two types of clients: one who wants a dance monkey, or one who are happy to pay expert prices for long standing results”

- ”your brand isn’t built alone in your bedroom, but through collaboration with your audience.”

- not sure where to put business card comp
- add another about to contact comp?
-
- HERO content
- Why should you prefer a custom-made website, when you can simply use wix or wordpress? Because a custom website fits your business, personality, goals... and you alone.

- We have one main goal, to get more views towards your business! With Laughing Coyote Dev, you get more than just a website:
- Information displayed, accessible, easier to find on Google
- The ability to tell your story, owning a website gives you the ability to tell your business story without any limitations.
- Mobile Optimization- Studies show that majority of website use is through mobile phones and tablets
- -DAY SUMMARY- 5/12/24:\*\*

  -

EVENTUALLY- CREATE COMP (possibly dynamic) for client work grid

EVENTUALLY- MAKE DYNAMIC CONTAINER/PADDING/MARGINS FOR EACH SECTIONS

??make the first 1/2 of website a different color scheme than the second half. Both halves should blend into the other ??maybe opposite color schemes?

- JOURNAL NOTES-5/8/24:
- Lets not use the term case studies, instead just client work
- Save case studies for EH
-
-
-
- I THINK ARTICLES SHOULD BE DISPLAYED AFTER CONTENT READY. LETS STICK WITH PGS:
- HOMEPAGE
- SERVICES
- FEATURED WORK
- CONTACT
